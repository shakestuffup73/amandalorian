<h2> The Hunt: Find the Asset </h1>
<br>
<h3> A lone bounty hunter, Mandalorian, is tasked with finding a vague asset. With no information other than a radar tracker, Mando begins a general search in the Desert of Assembly and The Forest of Assembly. To find the asset, the player must click on each grid square. However, there are no guarantees the asset is there. If the user does not choose correctly in the allotted time, they will be forced to return to the pub and begin their quest again.</h3>

<h2> Finding The Asset </h2>
<br>
<h3>Congratulations! You have found The Asset. Had you known at the beginning that you would be charged with finding a Child on this bounty hunt, you probably would have never accepted the mission. But now you must choose...Do you:</h3>
<br>
<h3>Bring The Asset to the Client? Or Harbor The Child? </h3>
<br>
<h3>Returning the asset does not guarantee its safety, but it does guarantee your freedom. Harboring The Child means your life of bounty hunting will become a new mission - to return The Child to where it rightfully belongs...wherever that may be...</h3>
