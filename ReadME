AMANDALORIAN

ABOUT THE GAME

Amandalorian is the story of a bounty hunter, who the user plays as. Starting scene sets the plot of the game, and a button appears to "Play Game". Upon clicking the "Play Game" button, the user is brought to a pub, where a story appears about their "client" asking them to find "The Asset." Not much information is provided about what "The Asset" is, only that you must begin your search for it.  Two buttons appear for where to begin the search - the first button is "The Desert" and the second button is "The Forest." Both options will bring the user to a game of chance - clicking images to find and reveal "The Asset." However, clicks are risks! The first click that does not reveal "The Asset" begins a countdown timer. Find "The Asset" before the timer is up, or the board resets and randomizes again.  A button is available near both game boards to return to the pub scene, where you can explore the pub (animation/videos will appear) through button clicks. Upon successfully finding "The Asset," a story appears about how you did not know "The Asset" was actually a child. You are then presented with two options - a button to "Deliver the Asset" to your client, or a button to "Harbor the Child" and become a fugitive.  Choose your own adventure, play a game, then choose your ending!

// 3d) Must click to find "The Asset" before the timer expires (very short timer window, 7 sec)
// 3e) On timer expire, grid game is reset and randomizes location of "The Asset" - forces start over - Message is displayed to user about ship needing critical repairs and must begin search again
// 3f) Option button to return to "The Pub" scene

// 3l) On timer expire, grid game is reset and randomizes location of "The Asset" - forces start over - Message is displayed to user about fighting rogue Storm Troopers who are trying to find "The Asset" and must begin search again.
// 3m) Option button to return to "The Pub" scene
// 3n) 1/36 clicks on grid presents "The Asset" - aka, "The Child"

// 4. If click and find "The Asset" aka, "The Child"

// 4a) Story scrolls up the screen in the same manner as the opening credits scene about how you did not know this 50-year old "Asset" was a child...
// 4b) Once story stops, two buttons appear
// 4c) One button is option to deliver "The Asset" to the client as agreed upon for the bounty
// 4d) Other button is option to harbor "The Child" and become a fugitive, evade your client

// 5) Deliver "The Asset" button - on click, presents a story about sad Baby Yoda, but you're rich now
// 5) Harbor "The Child" button - on click, presents a story about how you're now responsible for Baby Yoda and must find Skywalker
